    </header>
    
    <section class="content">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) and oxygen (O₂) from carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O). It occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).</p>

        <h2>1. Misrepresentation</h2>
        <p><strong>Simplified Net Equation:</strong></p>
        <div class="code-box">6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂</div>
        <p>This oversimplified equation in school academia has caused a huge miscommunication of what is happening with Photosynthesis. Teaching usually goes as light energy is used to break the Oxygen O₂ molecules from CO₂, and this O₂ is released into the atmosphere. This is wrong!</p>
        <p><strong>Detailed Equation (showing full water use):</strong></p>
        <div class="code-box">12H₂O + 6CO₂ + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ + 6H₂O</div>
        <p>It’s the O₂ from H₂O water molecules that gets released out of the plants at the end of photosynthesis. Note: 12 water molecules are split, and 6 are reformed, resulting in a net use of 6 water molecules.</p>

        <h3>Isotopic Labelling Experiment</h3>
        <p>In 1941, Ruben and Kamen conducted an experiment using the isotope Oxygen-18 (¹⁸O) to determine the source of oxygen released during photosynthesis. They labeled water (H₂O) with ¹⁸O and carbon dioxide (CO₂) with ¹⁸O separately and observed the oxygen gas (O₂) released by plants.</p>
        <p>The results showed that when water containing ¹⁸O was used, the released oxygen gas (O₂) contained ¹⁸O. However, when carbon dioxide containing ¹⁸O was used, the released oxygen gas did not contain ¹⁸O. This conclusively demonstrated that the oxygen released during photosynthesis comes from water (H₂O), not carbon dioxide (CO₂).</p>
        <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The isotopic labeling experiment was pivotal in correcting the misconception about the source of oxygen in photosynthesis.</p>

        <h2>2. Light-Dependent Reactions</h2>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts</p>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photolysis:</strong> Water is split using light energy: 
                <div class="code-box">12H₂O → 24H⁺ + 6O₂ + 24e⁻</div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Electron Transport Chain (ETC):</strong> Electrons from water pass through photosystems II and I, generating ATP (via chemiosmosis) and NADPH.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Products:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>ATP (energy carrier)</li>
            <li>NADPH (reducing agent)</li>
            <li>O₂ (released as a byproduct from water)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Oxygen released comes solely from water, not CO₂.</p>

        <h2>3. Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)</h2>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Stroma of chloroplasts</p>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carbon Fixation:</strong> CO₂ is combined with RuBP (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate) by the enzyme RuBisCO to form 3-PGA (3-phosphoglycerate).</li>
            <li><strong>Reduction:</strong> 3-PGA is reduced to G3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) using ATP and NADPH.</li>
            <li><strong>Regeneration:</strong> Some G3P molecules regenerate RuBP, while others form glucose.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Products:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)</li>
            <li>Regenerated RuBP (to continue the cycle)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Tracking the Atoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oxygen Atoms:</strong> From Water (12H₂O): 12 oxygen atoms are released as 6O₂. From CO₂ (6CO₂): 12 oxygen atoms are incorporated into glucose (6 in C₆H₁₂O₆) and the reformed 6H₂O (6 oxygen atoms).</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrogen Atoms:</strong> 24 hydrogen atoms from 12H₂O are used: 12 in glucose and 12 in the reformed 6H₂O.</li>
            <li><strong>Carbon Atoms:</strong> 6 carbon atoms from 6CO₂ form glucose.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> "Leftover" hydrogen ions and electrons are used to produce ATP and NADPH; oxygen from CO₂ not in glucose ends up in reformed water.</p>

        <h2>5. Energy Flow</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Light Energy:</strong> Captured by chlorophyll in the light-dependent reactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical Energy:</strong> Stored as ATP and NADPH.</li>
            <li><strong>Glucose Production:</strong> ATP and NADPH power the Calvin cycle to convert CO₂ into glucose.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Summary of Key Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oxygen Source:</strong> Released O₂ comes only from water (H₂O), not CO₂.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Use:</strong> 12H₂O are split, but 6H₂O are reformed, resulting in a net use of 6H₂O.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal Use:</strong> Hydrogen ions and electrons from water produce ATP and NADPH; oxygen from CO₂ not in glucose is in reformed water.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Transformation:</strong> Light energy is converted into chemical energy (glucose) through a two-stage process.</li>
        </ul>
