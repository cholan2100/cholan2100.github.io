        <h2>What is Light Reflection?</h2>
        <p>Reflection occurs when light interacts with a surface and bounces off in a predictable direction. This follows the fundamental <strong>Law of Reflection</strong>:</p>

        <p>Reflection can be understood from two perspectives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wave Perspective:</strong> Light behaves as an electromagnetic wave, where each wavefront reflects in an orderly manner, maintaining coherence on smooth surfaces and scattering on rough ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Particle Perspective:</strong> Light consists of photons that interact with electrons on the surface, which then re-radiate light in a direction dictated by conservation of momentum.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Forced Oscillation</h2>
        <img src="images/oscillation.jpg" alt="Scattering of Light Diagram">
        <p>When low-energy photons hit electrons on the surface of a material, the electrons begin to oscillate and almost instantaneously reradiate the photons. Individual electrons reradiate photons in random directions. However, the smooth distribution of atoms on the material's surface creates a cumulative effect where the probability of reradiation aligns predominantly in a specific direction. This collective behavior, governed by the <strong>Conservation of Momentum</strong>, gives rise to the law of reflection.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Do Smooth Surfaces Reflect Light?</h2>
        <p>When light hits a smooth surface, the interaction with electrons causes light to be re-radiated in a specific direction. This happens because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wave Perspective:</strong> All the tiny scattered waves combine constructively, reinforcing a single outgoing wavefront.</li>
            <li><strong>Particle Perspective:</strong> Each photon excites electrons, which then re-emit light in a way that preserves momentum and maintains a uniform reflection angle.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Uniform Surface:</strong> Since the surface is even, all parts reflect light in the same direction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Do Rough Surfaces Scatter Light?</h2>
        <li><strong>Conservation of Momentum:</strong> Because the surface is uneven, the absorbed and re-emitted photons follow different angles, causing scattered reflection while still preserving the total momentum.</li>
        <p>On rough surfaces, the laws of reflection still apply at each microscopic point, but since the surface is uneven, light bounces in different directions. This results in <strong>diffuse reflection</strong>, where light spreads instead of forming a clear reflection.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wave Perspective:</strong> The disordered surface disrupts the coherence of wavefronts, causing them to scatter in multiple directions.</li>
            <li><strong>Particle Perspective:</strong> Photons interact with electrons at varying angles due to surface irregularities, leading to random reflection angles.</li>
            <li><strong>Conservation of Momentum:</strong> Because the surface is uneven, the absorbed and re-emitted photons follow different angles, causing scattered reflection while still preserving the total momentum.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/rough_reflection.png" alt="Rough Surface Reflection">
        
        <h2>How Water Reflects Light</h2>
        <p>Water can act as both a smooth and rough surface:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wave Perspective:</strong> When water is calm, it forms a continuous reflective wavefront; when wavy, reflections scatter due to uneven phase interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Particle Perspective:</strong> Photons reflecting from still water follow strict reflection angles, while turbulent water alters photon interactions, causing diffuse scattering.</li>
            <li><strong>Conservation of Momentum:</strong> Whether smooth or wavy, the reflection of photons from water follows momentum conservation laws, ensuring energy and directionality constraints are maintained.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Reflection can be seen as collective scattering in a single direction. Whether considering smooth or rough surfaces, the fundamental principles of light interaction remain consistent, governed by the laws of reflection and conservation of momentum.</p>
